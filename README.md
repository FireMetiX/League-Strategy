## About

This Website is about the game League of Legends and is used for creating Champion guides.

This project was about creating a CMS but is also a web application.

## How done is it?

There is still a lot to do until the Website is reliable for creating a clean and functioning guide, but i am getting there.

I like the Design but sometimes my Website feels boring to watch so i will be doing some tweeks so that the Website will be working and looking as good as i want it to be.

I am still learning, but like i said: i am getting there.

## Future plans for the Website

- I'd like to create a Item Build system, that alows the User of the Website to create Item sets for the Champion he or she has choosen to create a guide for.
- User Profiles would be nice to have
- commenting and rating guides is also essential for a good expirience
